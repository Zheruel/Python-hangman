# Python hangman

Note: This is an old project that is not being actively maintained and doesn't reflect my current skill-set.

Fully functional hangman game created in Python using Requests and BeautifoulSup to scrape a list of common words from the internet.
You are guaranteed to never get the same word twice in one play session no matter how long it is!
